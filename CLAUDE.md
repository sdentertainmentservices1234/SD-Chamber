# SD Chamber — Claude Code handover

Chamber-management PWA for a Supreme Court senior advocate's chamber. Save this
file as `CLAUDE.md` in the repository root — Claude Code reads it automatically.

## What this app is

A work-allocation and cause-list tool **between the clerk and the juniors**.
The senior advocate is deliberately NOT a user (role removed by owner decision).

## Review-pass changes (Jul 2026, most recent)

- **Roster includes not-yet-signed-in members equally** (`rosterQueue`): a
  colleague added but not logged in is ranked by workload like everyone (owner:
  login doesn't matter for assignment; a "pending:<email>" gets matters that
  migrate on first login). Only on-leave-today sinks. Row shows their load + "not
  yet signed in".
- **Leave register hard-deletes** (`renderLeave`): deleted entries are GONE, not
  struck-through (owner wanted a clean register). Delete → `db.remove`; the list
  filters `!l.deleted` so any existing soft-deleted rows also vanish.
- **Senior-unavailable = no additions** (owner's rule): `seniorOff(iso)` days block
  adding a day-sheet listing (`f_save`, import add) and a brief `nextDate`
  (`b_save`, `ob_next`), with a toast. The Day sheet hides Add/Import + shows a
  notice on those days. Calendar marks senior-away LOUDLY (`.sen-away`: red tint +
  red bar + "Senior away" tag), overriding the neutral day-kind styling.
- **Board nav label is dynamic** (`paintChrome()`): colleagues land on the
  personal `renderMyWork()` home, so their sidebar/mobile board item reads **"My
  work"**; Staff/admin keep **"Work board"**. Label matches the page.
- **New-brief assignment mode** (`briefForm()`): a `.seg` toggle — **Choose
  colleague** (the existing checklist, now with each person's active count) vs
  **Auto-assign** (roster engine, with a live `#autoPickName` preview of who it
  lands on). Save-time auto path reuses `pickNext()` + `advancePointer()` and
  records `assignHistory` mode `auto`/`forced`, identical to the standalone
  `autoAssign()`. `asgnMode` var drives it; `directed` is manual-only.
- **Roster fairness view** (`renderRoster()`): a colleague sees a
  `.roster-standing-banner` ("You're #N in the rotation · next up in K turns ·
  carrying … active … lifetime") and a **You** tag + `.is-me` accent on their
  own row. Banner is colleagues-only (Staff/admin aren't in the rotation).
- **Demo seed** (`make-test.py`): dropped the fake "Sample holiday/Sample
  vacation" clutter; seeds the real SC summer-vacation range via
  `config/vacation` so the preview shows true calm shading.

## Branding & onboarding copy (Jul 2026)

- **SD logo**: gold Fraunces "SD" with a hairline underline (echoes the app
  icon). `.sb-logo` in the sidebar masthead (gold on navy); `.brand-mark` =
  navy rounded tile w/ gold SD on the light auth + pending cards. Colour scheme
  unchanged (navy #101418 / gold #cbb682 institutional).
- **Onboarding relabelled** away from "invite / pre-approve" to just **"Add
  member"** (owner's call — Adith enters real members, no approval step in his
  head). The MECHANISM is unchanged: still `approvals/{emailLower}` claimed on
  first sign-in (the only credential-free way — Firestore users are uid-keyed).
  Button "Add member", panel "Members — awaiting first sign-in", form fields
  name/email/role/phone/joinedOn. Junior signs in with that email + "Set your
  password". Keep the approvals-doc plumbing; only the words changed.
- **Roster shows added-but-not-logged-in members** (`rosterDisplay()` merges
  role=junior approvals into the seniority list, tagged "awaiting first login",
  no loads). effectiveRoster()/assignment still use logged-in `users` only —
  a member with no uid can't be assigned/ack until they activate. The People
  directory (Chamber tab) stays alphabetical-by-role; the Roster is seniority.

## Terminology (Jul 2026 — display only)

The owner renamed the user-facing labels: **Clerk → "Staff"**, **Junior →
"Chamber Colleague"** (plural "Chamber Colleagues", shortened to "Colleagues"
where space is tight). The internal role KEYS are unchanged (`clerk`,
`junior`) — data, comparisons (`me.role==="junior"`), `juniors()`,
`juniorUid(s)`, `heldForClerk`, and the security rules all still use the old
keys. Only `ROLES` labels and rendered copy changed. Keep it that way; a key
rename would touch Firestore data + rules for no benefit.

## Roles & onboarding (Jul 2026 — load-bearing)

Three personas, split by a hard rule: **all TECHNICAL feeding is Adith's; the
clerk only does day-to-day operational input.**
- **admin** (Adith Deshmukh, `adithdeshmukh@gmail.com`): members, their contact
  details + joining dates, email pre-approval, matter weights, holiday calendar.
  Recognised BY EMAIL (`CHAMBER.adminEmail`) as well as by `role:"admin"`, so
  his first-ever login is admin with no chicken-and-egg — **never remove the
  email check**. `isAdmin()` / `canAdmin()` gate every technical surface.
- **clerk/pa**: matters (briefs), conferences, senior availability, day sheet,
  assignment. `canManage()` = admin+clerk+pa. Clerk is NOT technically adept —
  no member management, no weights, no holidays surface at all.
- **junior**: self-onboards. Adith pre-approves their email
  (`approvals/{emailLower}` with role+details) → junior visits the app, uses
  **"Set your password"** (`auth.signUp` = createUserWithEmailAndPassword) →
  `onAuthStateChanged` claims the approval, creates their `users/{uid}` at the
  approved role, deletes the approval. No manual approval step. An un-invited
  sign-in lands as `pending` (the "Not approved yet" screen). Demo has no real
  auth, so the Chamber tab exposes a **"Simulate sign-in"** button on each
  invite to exercise the claim end-to-end.
- **Colleague has LEFT the chamber (`retireColleague`, Jul 2026):** the member
  editor (`roleForm`, admin-only, not on self/admin) has a danger-zone **"Colleague
  has left the chamber"** button. It keeps their RECORD (user doc + name; every
  disposed matter and past day sheet untouched, so their name still shows on the work
  they did) but removes them from everything LIVE: sets `active:false` + `leftOn`
  (the existing `active!==false` filters already drop them from roster, snapshot,
  assignment and all colleague pickers/People), and DETACHES them from every
  NON-disposed brief (assignedTo/ackBy, clears their creditClaim/reassignReq) plus
  today/future day-sheet listings + conferences — so their live credit stops and a
  co-colleague inherits the FULL share (a solo active matter falls back to
  unassigned → reassign from the board). The confirm dialog counts solo-vs-shared
  active matters. A muted **"Former members"** panel on the Workload snapshot lists
  `active===false` members (record kept) and reopens them in `roleForm`, where
  re-checking "Active member" brings them back — so removal is reversible.
  jsc-verified (solo→unassigned, shared→co-colleague inherits, disposed record kept,
  claim cleared) + live demo (removed a colleague: island/People/roster/picker drop,
  Former-members shows them, solo matters freed, no errors). Distinct from the old
  soft "Active member" checkbox, which only hid them and left them attached to live
  matters (stale credit dilution). sw.js `chamber-shell-v24→v25`.
- **Restore-credit PANEL removed (Jul 2026, owner):** the amber "Restore credit —
  N removed identities" panel on the Workload-snapshot view kept nagging for a
  colleague who was deleted and re-added, so it was deleted from `renderSnapshotBody`.
  `remapAssignee(oldId,newUid)` is RETAINED (call it from the console for a one-off
  fix); `orphanAssignees()`/`remapTargets()` are now dead. The board's separate
  "assigned to an inactive member — needs reassignment" notice is unrelated and
  still shows. Original mechanism, for reference:
- **Restore credit for a re-added colleague (Jul 2026):** because members are
  id-keyed, deleting a colleague (e.g. wrong email) and adding them back mints a
  NEW id — their old matters still name the OLD id, so their credit disappears.
  Nothing is destroyed: `orphanAssignees()` finds assignee ids referenced in
  briefs / day sheets / leaves that are neither a current member nor a live invite
  (`currentIdSet()`), and an **admin-only "Restore credit" panel** on the Team →
  Workload snapshot view lets Adith map each orphan onto the right colleague.
  `remapAssignee(oldId,newUid)` rewrites assignedTo / everAssigned / ackBy /
  assignHistory(.uid+.by) / declinedBy / creditClaim across briefs, juniorUids on
  day sheets, and leaves.uid — deduping so a shared matter isn't double-counted.
  Works for a deleted invite (`pending:wrongEmail`) or a removed uid. jsc-verified
  (detect + remap + dedup, no false positives) + live UI test (add invite → assign
  → delete invite → restore onto a colleague). `remapAssignee` updates the local
  `briefs`/`dsAll`/`leaves` optimistically before the Firestore echo, so the panel
  clears at once instead of lingering a round-trip (owner: "still flashing").

## Display board — Regular list is numbered 101+ (board.html)

Regular-list matters are numbered in the **101+ series**; a court finishes its
whole Misc list (main + supp) before starting Regular. In `classify()` for a
`listType=Regular` matter still behind Misc: `gap = miscLeft + (regRank − 1)` where
`regRank = itemNo − 100` (item 101 = the 1st Regular matter, so it's `miscLeft`
away, NOT `miscLeft + 101`). `miscLeft` = causelist Misc total (`miscTotalFor`,
main+supp) or the live sequence position. **Important (owner Jul 2026): Misc runs
1…200+ and CAN reach into the 101 range, so item size alone can't tell Misc from
Regular.** `onRegularList()` therefore detects Regular two ways: current item `>
miscTotal` (Misc < 101 days), OR the item **resetting** from ≈ the end of Misc back
down into the 101 series (`itemHi` per-court high vs a big drop; Misc ≥ 101 days).
Then it uses normal within-Regular proximity. The badge says **"N away"** (owner:
not "Reg N"); the detail label still reads "Regular — ~N away · Misc: K to go".
**Reserved item series = court PHASE, not a queue position (owner Jul 2026):** a
current board item in the **800s = mentioning**, the **1500s = judgement
pronouncement** — classify returns "mentioning is on" / "pronouncement is on" with
NO gap (our matter just waits). jsc-verified: small/large-Misc, 800→mentioning,
1500→pronouncement, "N away" not "Reg N".

**Passover-aware "N away" (owner Jul 2026):** the normal-proximity gap now folds in
passovers, not just OVER items. `passoverItemsFor(court)` gathers every passed-over
item (remark column `isPassOver` + shared `config/live.po` marks + board-observed
`boardPO`), and `poAdjust(court,cur,ours,seq,passIdx)` returns a net delta to the
items-ahead count: **−1** for each item passed over ahead of us that is recalled
AFTER us (deferred behind us → no longer ahead), **+1** for each passed-over matter
recalled BEFORE us (pulled in ahead → adds to the wait). Recall point = the mark's
own "after N" hint, else the sequence's declared passover slot (`seqInfo().passIdx`),
else end-of-board. Works in sequence space when the bench declares a sequence, else
in item-number space (where passIdx is ignored — it's a seq index). Applied right
after the existing `overAhead` discount; the detail label gains "· N passed over
ahead" / "· N recalled first". jsc-verified 8 cases (deferred-to-end, recalled-
before-us via passIdx, behind-us-recalled-ahead, our-item-already-passed, none).

**Sequence-order "N away" (owner fix Jul 2026):** the gap is now the distance in the
court's TRUE call order, not raw item numbers. `orderPos(seq,item)` returns an item's
index in the full expected order = the declared sequence in its given order, THEN
every other item ascending ("…then the rest of the matters"). So for "1-17, 21, 30,
52-54, passover, rest", when the board reaches 21 items 18/19/20 are NOT shown over —
they wait in the rest (18 = 5 away: 30,52,53,54,then 18). `classify` uses
`orderPos(ours)−orderPos(cur)` whenever a sequence is declared, and only falls back to
numeric subtraction when there is NO sequence. The OLD bug: `proximity` returned
gap=null for any item not literally in the sequence list, so classify hit the numeric
fallback and reported a "rest" item as over. jsc-verified on the owner's exact example
(cur21→ours18/19/20 = 5/6/7 away; both-in-rest; already-passed).

**Our-matter passed over, NO sequence declared (owner Aug 2026):** when OUR matter is
passed over and the court has NOT published a sequence, don't show a bare "recall"
badge — assume the court takes passovers at the **END of the board** and compute a real
distance. In `classify`'s passover branch: gap = `(miscTotalFor(court) − currentItem)`
(matters still to be called before the board finishes) `+ passoversBeforeOurs(court,ours)`
(other passed-over matters with a lower item number, recalled before ours). Falls back to
"passed over" (no number, still never the word "recall") only when no causelist total is
fetched. An explicit "recall after item N" mark with no sequence is honoured in
item-number space (`N − cur + 1`). The sequence case is unchanged in number (recall at
the `passIdx` slot, else sequence end) but relabelled from "recall" → "passed over".
New helper `passoversBeforeOurs`. jsc-verified against the real functions: no-seq
25-total/cur-3 → 22 away; +2 passovers before → 24; past-end → NEXT; no-total → "passed
over"; after-item-20 → 18 away.

**Cancelling "over"/PO now actually clears it (owner fix Jul 2026):** `clearDone` /
`clearPO` wrote the marks map back with `db.set(...,{merge:true})` after `delete`-ing
the key — but prod Firestore DEEP-merges nested maps, so a removed key PERSISTS: the
strike-through stayed and the court stayed untracked. Fixed by writing a **null
tombstone** for the key instead of deleting (`doneOf`/`poFor` already read null as
absent); clears correctly under both the demo shallow-merge and Firestore deep-merge.
Simulated-deep-merge test reproduces the bug with the old delete and confirms the null
fix. board-sw cache `sdboard-v11→v12`.

## Display-board chat — fresh every day (board.html, Jul 2026)

Owner: "Every day should be a fresh chat window, no past messages; old chats
deleted." The chat now shows ONLY today's messages (`todayMsgs()` filters
`messages` by `msgDay(m)===todayISO()`), so nothing from a past day ever renders.
`purgeOldChat()` (once/session, best-effort) deletes messages older than today —
the rules let a member delete their OWN and let Staff/PA/admin delete anyone's, so
a manager opening the board clears the shared history fully, a colleague clears
their own; either way the day-filter already hides the rest. `sendChat` stamps
`day:todayISO()`. Interface reworked to best-practice: a sticky "Today · Wed 20 Jul"
day pill, WhatsApp-style bubbles (mine right / others left, sender name on others
only), consecutive same-sender messages grouped (`.grp`, 4-min window), IST clock
times (HH:MM, not jittery "Xm ago"). The messages watcher now calls **`paintChatList()`**
(rewrites only `#chatList`) instead of `renderChat()` — an incoming message can no
longer wipe what a colleague is typing or steal focus; the view stays pinned to the
newest message unless the reader scrolled up. `board-sw.js` cache `sdboard-v10→v11`.
jsc-verified (day filter + purge selection) + live (render, grouping, send keeps
composer focused, no errors).

**Keyboard-aware chat (owner fix Jul 2026):** on a phone the soft keyboard used to
cover half the chat and the box scrolled/resized. `fitChat()` now pins `#chatWrap`
to `window.visualViewport` — `body.chat-vv` makes it `position:fixed` with JS-set
`--chat-top`(header bottom)/`--chat-h`(`vv.height − header − nav`), so the composer
always sits just above the keyboard and ONLY `#chatList` scrolls; the box never
grows. When the keyboard is up (`innerHeight−vv.height>120`) the bottom nav hides
(`body.kb-open`) and the nav-height reserve drops to 0. Re-fits on
`visualViewport` resize/scroll, window resize, and input focus/blur; the tab-switch
handler and `renderChat` call it (leaving chat clears the classes). Falls back to the
flex layout where `visualViewport` is absent. Verified live (fixed box, list is the
only scroller, composer pinned, leaving clears) — the keyboard-shrink path itself
needs a real device to see, but is the standard visualViewport pattern.

## Display-board FULL-SCREEN approach flash (board.html, Jul 2026)

Any of our matters **≤2 away** triggers a blinking full-screen overlay (`runFlash`
→ `showFlash`, called from `fetchBoard` after `runAlerts`). `reachingMatters()`
collects our matters with `0≤gap≤2` (skipping mentioning/over/done), one per court
(closest). The overlay **divides into one panel per reaching court** (`#flashHost.nN`
grid, capped 6); each panel shows, big and bold: **COURT n**, the distance
(`ON NOW`/`NEXT`/`N AWAY`), **ON** = item now on, **OURS** = our item. It blinks
red↔navy (`@keyframes flashpulse`), auto-clears after **3 s** (or tap) back to the
board. De-duped per court+item (`_flash.set`) so it fires once per approach and
skipped when `document.hidden`. Live-verified in the demo (two-court split =
Court 5/6 NEXT, and a single-court "2 AWAY" with ON/OURS). `board-sw` `v12→v13`.
**PERSISTENT (owner Jul 2026):** no more 3s auto-dismiss — the flash stays until the
screen is TOUCHED or the case is OVER (leaves the ≤2 set: called / marked over /
receded). `runFlash` re-renders the current reaching set live each poll; a tap adds
the shown court+item to `_flash.dismissed` (re-armed when they leave the ≤2 set), and
the flash hides when nothing is actively reaching.

**Route rail replaces the directive balloon (owner Jul 2026):** the old "where do I
go now" card (`.directive`/`renderRoute`) is removed. `#paneTop` now holds a
**`.route-rail`** (`renderRail`) — a horizontal strip of small court "stops" in the
order to visit them: our actionable matters, soonest-to-reach first (`reachMinsFor`,
sequence-aware gap + live pace), one stop per court (closest matter). Each stop shows
Court, distance (NOW/NEXT/N away/PO/WATCH), and `our <item> · on <cur> · ~Nm [est]`;
between stops a chevron with the **walk time** (`walkMin`, court distance). Tap a stop
→ `openCourtModal`. Live-verified (stops ordered Ct6/5 NEXT → Ct3 PO → Ct2 far →
Ct1 watch, 1m connectors). Senior location still shows as the grid `senpin`.
**Colour (owner Jul 2026): polite-but-urgent AMBER, not alarm red** — pulses
`#c68a24↔#8a6112` (`flashpulse`, 1.1s ease-in-out breathe), white/cream text; the
red version read as an emergency. On-brand with the chamber gold.

**Chat tweaks (owner Jul 2026):** (a) **No pinch-resize** — the viewport meta now
sets `maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no` (messaging-app behaviour) AND `fitChat`
early-returns when `visualViewport.scale ≠ 1`, so a pinch never grows/shrinks the
fixed chat box; only the keyboard resizes it. (b) **Unread badge survives refresh**
— `lastSeenChat` is now persisted to `localStorage.boardChatSeen` (init from it on
load) and advanced by `markChatSeen()` (called from `renderChat` and `paintChatList`
while on the chat tab) to the newest seen message's ts. Previously it reset to 0 each
reload, so every refresh re-flagged already-read messages as new. Live-verified:
badge clears on open, stays cleared across a reload (`boardChatSeen` persisted).

## Display-board CLOSED-PHONE PUSH (board.html + worker, Jul 2026 — see PUSH-SETUP.md)

Web Push (VAPID / aes128gcm) via the existing Cloudflare board worker — pops on a
phone even when the app is closed, for **chat** messages and **court ≤4 away**. NOT
Firebase; reuses `board-dev/worker.js`. **Inert until `VAPID_PUBLIC` is set in
board.html AND the worker has the KV binding `SUBS` + secrets `VAPID_PUBLIC/PRIVATE/
SUBJECT`** (setup steps in `PUSH-SETUP.md`). iOS 16.4+ requires the app be **installed
to the Home Screen** — no Safari-tab push.
- **Client (board.html):** the 🔔 bell → `syncPushSub()` subscribes via
  `pushManager.subscribe(applicationServerKey=VAPID_PUBLIC)` and POSTs the sub to the
  worker `/push-subscribe` (keyed by uid); bell-off → `dropPushSub()`. `relayPush()`
  POSTs `/push-send`. `sendChat` relays `{kind:"chat"}`; `fireCourtAlert` relays
  `{kind:"court", toUids:e.juniorUids, level, …}`. All no-op if `VAPID_PUBLIC===""`.
  `board-sw.js` gained a `push` handler (`sdboard-v15`).
- **Worker (`board-dev/worker.js`):** `export default {fetch(req,env)}` now also
  handles POST `/push-subscribe|/push-unsubscribe|/push-send`. Subs live in KV
  (`SUBS`, key `sub:<uid>:<hash>`); `/push-send` de-dups per event
  (`dd:court:… | dd:chat:<id>`, 600s TTL) so many open instances = one push, resolves
  recipients (court→toUids, chat→all subs minus sender), and sends Web Push
  (`vapidAuth` ES256 JWT + `encryptPayload` ECDH/HKDF/AES-128-GCM per RFC 8291); 404/
  410 prunes the sub.
- **Model = RELAY, not autonomous:** court pushes need SOME open board (bell on) to
  detect the crossing — keep the war-room display open during court hours; chat fires
  from the sender's open device. Fully-autonomous (worker cron polling the board, no
  open instance) is a future upgrade needing the proximity engine ported into the
  worker. **UNVERIFIED end-to-end** — the crypto/delivery can't be tested without a
  real installed PWA + deployed worker + VAPID keys; syntax-checked + demo loads clean
  (inert). Confirm on a device, iterate.

## Display-board alerts (board.html, Jul 2026 — Phase 1, no backend)

So nobody has to stare at the board. A **bell toggle** in the header
(`btnNotify`/`toggleNotify`, persisted in `localStorage.boardNotify`) requests
Notification permission and turns on alerts. On every poll, `runAlerts()` classifies
each of our matters and, when one crosses into **"get ready"** (tier soon → level 1)
then **"head now"** (tier now → level 2), fires a system notification via
`registration.showNotification` (+ vibration), deduped per court+item (`_alerted`,
re-arms if the matter recedes; skips mentioning). Messages: "⚖️ Head to Court 6 —
your item 4 is next" / "Get ready — Court 3 — item 6 approaching · ~3 min".
`board-sw.js` gained a `notificationclick` handler (focus/open the app); cache
bumped `sdboard-v4→v5`. A **screen wake lock** (`acquireWake`, re-acquired on
visibilitychange) keeps the app awake so it keeps polling. **Reliable only while the
app is open/awake** — fully-closed-phone push needs a server (Phase 2: VAPID + a
Cloudflare-cron/Function poller that reads the chamber's matters and sends Web Push;
the project's long-standing "FCM push = v2"). jsc-verified level transitions + live
(enabling fired "Head to Court 6 / Get ready — Court 3/5", no errors).

## Court-pace study — SEPARATE collector (`pace-collector.html`, Jul 2026)

Goal: learn each court's real disposal speed over ~a week, then replace the flat
`MIN_PER_ITEM=1.1` default in `reachMinsFor` with a per-court, time-of-day pace.
Owner's call: keep the display app (board.html) UNBURDENED — do the collection in a
**standalone page**. `pace-collector.html` is self-contained (no Firebase/auth):
polls the board relay every 60s, reuses the same `parseBoard`/`seqInfo`/`posOf`, and
whenever a court moves to a new item appends `[t, seqPos, item, phase]` to a
per-court, per-day movement log in **localStorage** (`scPaceData_v1`). phase: 0
hearing · 1 idle · 2 mentioning(800s) · 3 pronouncement(1500s) — analysis ignores
1/2/3. UI: live status + per-court moves/≈items-per-hr + **Download / Copy** (owner
pastes the JSON back into chat). Served at `…/pace-collector.html`; leave it open
during court hours. **Analysis + calibration are done HERE from the pasted data**,
then only the resulting timing logic goes into board.html — the collector never
ships to the display app. jsc-verified (parse real sample, phase codes, movement
dedup) + live (fetched the live board, recorded 19 courts, no errors).

## Conference credit + credit register (index.html, Jul 2026)

- **Editing a listing's colleague REPLACES on the brief, not unions (owner fix
  Jul 2026):** `f_save` reconciles the linked brief's `assignedTo` with the
  listing's `juniorUids`. A NEW listing (idx null) ADDS its colleague; EDITING a
  listing removes whoever that listing named before (`jrsOf(e)` swapped out) and
  adds the new pick, so swapping A→B moves the WHOLE credit to B instead of
  crediting `[A,B]` split. Colleagues assigned to the file elsewhere are kept.
  The old code unioned + gated on length only, so a 1→1 swap silently split
  credit. jsc-verified (5 reconcile cases) + live (day-sheet edit A→B → brief
  detail shows B alone). `assignedTo` stays the single source of truth for credit
  (linked listings' juniorUids don't feed credit; only `b.assignedTo` does).
- **Manual duplicate merge (`mergeDuplicateForm`, owner Jul 2026):** the
  auto-merge only collapses briefs that share a case/diary number (≥8 norm chars)
  or an EXACT normalised title — so a real duplicate slips through when one copy
  is missing its number AND the titles differ (a different respondent captured, a
  truncation, a typo). Loosening the auto-merge to partial-title matching was
  REJECTED — it would wrongly merge distinct matters between common parties
  ("Union of India vs A" / "…vs B"). Instead, the brief detail (canManage) has
  **"This is a duplicate — merge into another file"** → a searchable picker of
  every other brief; choosing the keeper runs the SAME `_mergeBriefInto(keep,dup)`
  as the auto-merge (repoints listings + conferences, unions colleagues, carries
  missing details, removes the dup, credit counted once). Live-verified (pick →
  confirm → count −1, dup gone, no errors). Use this for the "listed twice, no
  shared number" cases the auto-merge can't safely infer.
- **A day-sheet conference LINKED to a matter (`c.briefId`) earns NO ½ credit**
  (owner fix Jul 2026): the colleague was already credited when the matter was
  listed, so `conferenceCreditsOf` skips any conference with a `briefId`. Only a
  STANDALONE conference (no linked matter) still earns the split ½.
- **Duplicate-brief prevention + merge (owner Jul 2026):** a matter listed in two
  different weeks must appear ONCE in the register with both listing dates, not as
  two briefs. `findBriefForListing` dedups on input by case number (`_normCase` —
  drops the "No." token so "SLP(C) No. 18036/2026" == "SLP(C) 18036/2026", keeps the
  TYPE so C.A.≠SLP), diary number, then normalised title (`_normTitle` — strips
  vs/versus + "& Ors./Anr." + punctuation). `mergeDuplicateBriefs()` (runs once per
  admin/clerk session in `maybeSyncRegister`) collapses EXISTING duplicates that
  share a case/diary number (>=8 normalised chars = a real unique number, so it can
  never merge two different matters): keeps the oldest, repoints the newer's
  listings + conferences, unions assignees, carries missing details, deletes the
  dup; toasts "Merged N…". jsc-verified (key collapse + full merge mechanics; C.A. vs
  SLP same-number NOT merged).

- A standalone / preliminary / strategy conference (no listed matter, or a matter
  not yet listed) earns **½ credit**, split equally. Modelled as a brief with
  `confCredit:true` (status `disposed`, `nextDate`=conference date). `shareFor`'s
  base is `0.5` for `confCredit` (so solo ½, shared ¼). Added via the **Conference**
  button next to **Legal aid** on the Briefs topbar (`conferenceCreditForm`), and
  it counts in lifetime + the period tally like any matter (worth ½).
- **Ad-hoc conference credit (preferred path):** `confForm` (day sheet → Add
  conference) has a **colleague multi-select** — a conference with colleagues set
  earns ½ credit split, stored on `daysheet.conferences[].juniorUids`.
  `conferenceCreditsOf(uid)` scans ALL day sheets' conferences (any date) so adding
  a colleague to a PAST conference credits it at once; a conference with no colleague
  earns nothing. Wired into `lifetimeCount` + `loadInWindow` + `creditLedger`. (The
  earlier Briefs "Conference" button / `confCredit` brief was removed as a duplicate;
  its credit math stays for backward-compat with any already created.)
- **Credit register is a full SECTION, not a popup** (owner: "I want a proper
  section redirect"): clicking a Workload-snapshot island sets `_regUid` and
  `renderTeam` swaps the whole Team view for `registerSectionHtml` — a **real
  `<table>`** with fixed columns (`.reg-table`: # 38px · Matter/conference flex ·
  Date 112px · Credit 70px, zebra rows, tfoot total), a back-to-Snapshot button, a
  Week/Month/Year toggle (`_regPeriod`), a big period total + a "N matters · N
  conferences" breakdown. `creditLedger(uid,period)` enumerates the SAME
  contributions as `loadInWindow`, so the register total and the island number match
  in display (both via `fmtPts`). jsc-verified (conf 0.5 / shared 0.25 / past dates;
  ledger==loadInWindow at display precision; week ≤ month ≤ year).
Priorities, in the owner's words:

1. **Primary:** work allocation and distribution among ~10 juniors
2. **Secondary:** clerk's ease in preparing the daily chamber cause list
3. **Third:** linking those two functions
4. **Ancillary:** linking assigned matters to their records (Drive links) accessible to all

Human context that shapes every decision: **Adith (the owner) runs the
infrastructure; the clerk is technologically challenged** — he can prepare a
cause list and send files on WhatsApp/email, nothing more. Every clerk-facing
flow must stay at that level: type court+item, click share. Everything is
shared within the chamber — no information walls between members (owner's
explicit instruction; the old senior-notes restriction was removed from both
UI and rules).

## Deployment state (as of handover)

- **Live app:** https://sdentertainmentservices1234.github.io/SD-Chamber/
- **Repo:** `SD-Chamber` under GitHub user `sdentertainmentservices1234`
- **Firebase project:** `sd-chamber-1aa78` (Auth email/password ON, Firestore
  in `asia-south1`, rules published — current version below)
- **firebaseConfig is baked into index.html** (public by design; security is
  in the rules): apiKey AIzaSyAagQ_-1LLvKtmsfJwSPJvURHWB-FkO-NQ, project
  sd-chamber-1aa78, appId 1:287957629475:web:9c7804acf3060c73abcf96,
  storageBucket sd-chamber-1aa78.firebasestorage.app
- **IMPORTANT divergence risk:** the owner edited `seniorName` directly on
  GitHub with the pencil editor. Any regenerated index.html from this codebase
  has `PASTE_SENIOR_NAME_HERE`. Before pushing a new index.html, read the live
  repo's current seniorName and carry it over, or you will clobber his edit.
- First clerk bootstrap (Firebase Auth user + Firestore role flip to `clerk`)
  was in progress at handover — verify a `users` doc with role `clerk` exists
  before assuming multi-user flows work.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Production app. `const DEMO = false;` + real firebaseConfig. |
| `demo.html` / `app.html` | Same code with `DEMO = true` — in-memory mock, seeded sample chamber, amber "View as" role switcher. No login. |
| `sw.js` | Service worker (Jul 2026): the app **HTML is NETWORK-FIRST** so a deployed change is live on the next open (cache is only the offline fallback); the heavy immutable libs — **Firebase SDK + fonts + Tabler icons are CACHE-FIRST** so mobile stays fast. NEVER caches Firestore/Auth/`court-updates.json` (live data). Registered from index.html head. `CACHE` now `chamber-shell-v9`. `board-sw.js` = same pattern for the war room (`sdboard-v3`). NOTE: the previous stale-while-revalidate version made HTML one-open-behind (owner: "change is not live") — hence network-first HTML. |
| `manifest.json` | PWA manifest (navy #101418, maskable icons). Linked from index.html head. |
| `icon-192.png` / `icon-512.png` / `apple-touch-icon.png` | App icon: gold "SD" monogram in Fraunces on the sidebar-navy. Regenerate with `python3 make-icon.py` (Pillow + Fraunces TTF, self-downloading); never hand-transcribe base64. |
| `firestore.rules` | Security rules — **git-ignored by owner's decision (Jul 2026), kept only locally / in the Firebase console**, NOT hosted on GitHub. Recover the last committed copy with `git show f2073ff:firestore.rules`. Still the source of truth for what the console rules must be. |
| `test.html` | Real-chamber test build (owner's juniors + the 13.07.2026 paper list), regenerated by `make-test.py`. Never deploy it. |
| `make-test.py` | Rebuilds test.html from index.html after edits: `python3 make-test.py`. |
| `fetch_causelist.py` + `.github/workflows/causelist.yml` | Scheduled Action: fetch SC lists → per-court benches → commits `court-updates.json` (repo root). See the SC cause-list section + CAUSELIST-SETUP.md. Test the parser OFFLINE against saved PDFs; don't hammer the live site in dev. |

Single-file architecture is deliberate (owner deploys by uploading one file,
edits via GitHub pencil). Do not split into modules without his say-so.

## Architecture

One `<script type="module">`. Two-branch data layer selected by `DEMO`:

```js
db.watchCollection(path, cb, [orderField, dir]) -> unsub   // cb gets [{id,...}]
db.watchDoc(path, cb) -> unsub                              // cb gets {id,...}|null
db.set(path, data, merge) / db.add(path, data) / db.update(path, data) / db.remove(path)
db.now()            // serverTimestamp in prod; {_t: Date.now()} in demo
auth.onChange / signIn / signOut / setUser(demo only)
```

Demo branch: in-memory Map store + synchronous listeners + `seedDemo()`
(50 matters, deliberately skewed distribution, SC index for today, demo
eventualities). Prod branch: Firebase v10.12.2 ESM from gstatic CDN,
top-level await imports.

**Subscription lifecycle (fixed bug — do not regress):** `auth.onChange`
tears down ALL watchers (`unsub[]`, `dsUnsub`, `scUnsub`, `userDocUnsub`) and
re-boots per user via a `booted` flag inside the users/{uid} watchDoc callback.
The old code only booted once, so data went stale after user switches.

Timestamps are dual-format everywhere: demo `{_t: ms}`, prod Firestore
Timestamp. Read with `x?._t ?? x?.toDate?.()` patterns; keep both paths alive.

## Data model (Firestore)

- `users/{uid}`: name, email, phone (for WhatsApp nudges), role
  (`admin|clerk|pa|junior|pending`), active, joinedOn (ISO date — sets chamber
  seniority; juniors sort by it everywhere, roster order derives from it)
- `approvals/{emailLower}`: {email, name, role, phone, joinedOn, by, at} —
  Adith's email pre-approvals. Keyed by the LOWERCASED email so rules can
  recompute the key from `request.auth.token.email.lower()` and verify the
  claimed role. Consumed + deleted on that person's first sign-in.
- `briefs/{id}`: caseTitle, diaryNo ("12345/2026"), caseNo, matterType,
  appearingFor, aor, status (`received|assigned|prep|ready|conf|listed|disposed`),
  priority, directed, detailsAwaited (auto: no diaryNo AND no caseNo),
  nextDate/conferenceAt (ISO), assignedTo[], everAssigned[], ackBy[],
  assignedAt (ms), declinedBy[{uid,ground,note,at}], heldForClerk,
  assignHistory[{uid,at,by?,mode}], createdBy/At, updatedAt
  - subcollections `comments/{id}` + `files/{id}` EXIST in the rules but their
    UI (Files & Discussion in the brief detail) was **removed Jul 2026** (owner:
    file/note upload is a later phase). Rules left in place (harmless); re-add
    the brief-detail sections when that phase resumes. Current app scope: brief
    details, causelist, work distribution + roster only.
- `daysheets/{YYYY-MM-DD}`: {date, entries[], conferences[], updatedAt, updatedBy} —
  entries: {briefId?, caseTitle, courtNo, itemNo (free text — "MM" = mentioning),
  listType (one of CAUSELIST_TYPES: Miscellaneous/Regular/Chamber/Single Judge/
  Registrar/Curative & Review — keys the SC bench lookup), time (default
  "10.30"), bench (auto-filled from the SC causelist by court+type+date), counsel
  (briefing counsel, autofilled from brief.aor), juniorUids[], juniorUid (legacy
  = juniorUids[0]; keep writing both, read via `jrsOf(e)`), remarks, done}. conferences: {time, name, briefId?} —
  the paper's evening "Conferences and meetings" list; clerk board auto-suggests
  briefs whose conferenceAt falls on that date. One doc per day, last-write-wins
  (acceptable: one clerk + one PA). Modelled 1:1 on the clerk's real paper cause
  list (letterhead → matters with bench + "briefing counsel — chamber juniors" →
  conferences by time).
- `scindex/{YYYY-MM-DD}`: {date, entries[], loadedBy, at} — parsed SC list:
  {court, item, diaryNo, caseNo, title, raw}
- `availability/{uid_date}`: {uid, date, status:`available|incourt|half|leave`, note}
- `config/roster`: {pointer:int} — order is no longer stored (owner's Jul 2026
  decision): the roster IS seniority order from users.joinedOn, senior-most
  first; manual reordering was removed. Old docs' `order` field is ignored.
- `config/weights`: {matterType: int 1–9} — live matter weights, editable from
  the Roster tab (clerk/pa). Merged over DEFAULT_WEIGHT in code; absent doc =
  defaults. Covered by existing config/* rules — no rules change needed.
- `config/holidays`: {dateISO: name|null} — SC holidays/vacations, entered by
  the clerk from the Calendar (per-day via day detail, or the "Mark holidays /
  vacation" range tool; null = cleared, checked via `!= null`). Deliberately
  under config/* so existing rules cover it.
- `config/senioravail`: {dateISO: note|null} — days the SENIOR is not
  available (he is not a user; the clerk inputs this). Same null semantics,
  same config/* rules rationale.

## Calendar (home screen — owner's request, Jul 2026)

The default tab for everyone (`curTab="cal"`; sixth mobile tab). Month grid,
Monday-first, Fraunces day numerals. Weekends auto-shaded "Non-sitting";
holidays tinted warn-bg with the name; senior-away days flagged with a
user-off icon; today ringed in accent. Per-day chips: total active matters
with that nextDate (everyone), "N mine" (juniors only — their assignedTo),
"N conf" (from that date's daysheet doc — the whole `daysheets` collection is
watched as `dsAll` for this). Clicking a day opens a detail sheet: the holiday-name input is ADMIN-ONLY
(technical feeding), the senior-availability input is clerk/pa/admin; plus the
day's matters (clickable), conferences, and an "Open day sheet" jump that sets
dsDate and switches tabs. The "Mark holidays / vacation" range tool is admin.
SC holiday data is ENTERED BY THE CLERK (range tool for vacations) — do not
fabricate/hardcode holiday dates; a future autofetch from sci.gov.in could
populate config/holidays the way the cause-list Action populates scindex.

## Assignment engine (the heart — owner's primary purpose)

- `weightOf(brief)` = `Math.max(1, Number(b.weight)||1)`. Weight is an OPTIONAL
  per-brief field the STAFF sets on the brief form (owner's call Jul 2026 —
  the old matter-type weight table + config/weights + Roster-tab editor were
  removed). Blank = 1 (every matter counts equally). `hasWeight(b)` gates the
  "N×" chips so unweighted matters show nothing.
- `isImminent(b)`: nextDate within 0–4 days → that brief counts **double**
  in `activeLoad(uid)`. This is how "junior busy with a matter coming up"
  auto-repels new work.
- `lifetimeCount(uid)`: LIFETIME count — every brief ever assigned
  (everAssigned), disposed included, counted **1 each — NO weightage** (owner's
  decision Jul 2026: weightage is only for immediate distribution, not the
  career clock). `totalLoad` (the old weighted-lifetime fn) was removed.
- `pickNext(brief, exclude)`: eligible = effectiveRoster() (= seniority order)
  minus declinedBy minus on-leave-today. **Fair-distribution cap (Jul 2026,
  owner's rule):** anyone who has taken **≥ CATCHUP_MAX (2)** fresh matters in
  the last **CATCHUP_WINDOW_MIN (90 min)** is held out of the pool (unless that
  empties it), so a batch spreads instead of piling on the lightest person —
  `recentAssigns(uid)` counts non-disposed assigned briefs with `assignedAt`
  inside the window. **Ranking metric = the WORKLOAD SNAPSHOT (owner Jul 2026,
  changed from activeLoad):** the pool is ranked by (`loadInWindow(id, loadPeriod)`
  asc [least credit done this period — exactly the number on the Workload snapshot],
  then recentAssigns asc, then lifetimeCount asc, then turn-distance from
  `roster.pointer` asc) — "snapshot → recent → lifetime → turn". `loadPeriod` is the
  shared week/month/year toggle (default month), so whichever period is selected on
  the snapshot/roster is what assignment uses. The Roster tab is now a **live
  workload queue** (`rosterQueue()` — lightest snapshot first, leave-today + not-yet-
  logged-in sink to the bottom); `nextUpUid()` = `pickNext` for a generic undated
  matter, so the "Next up" marker never disagrees with the engine.
  **Leave-clash skip (Jul 2026, owner's rule):** the matter's hearing date
  (`brief.nextDate`, or the day-sheet listing date passed in) blocks any colleague
  on leave that day OR the day before — prep happens the day before, so leave on
  the 12th bars matters listed on the 12th AND 13th. `leaveClash(uid,hearingDate)`
  = `onLeaveOn(hearingDate) || onLeaveOn(dayBefore(hearingDate))`; with no date on
  the brief it falls back to `isSkippable` (on leave today). Every pickNext call
  site now passes the date (autoAssign/objection via `brief.nextDate`; day sheet
  via the listing date; brief form via `b_next`). jsc-verified + live (Vikram on
  leave 19th → skipped for a 20th matter, still fine for the 18th). **CREDIT vs
  ASSIGNMENT split on the leave window (owner fix Jul 2026 — REVERSED the earlier
  coupling):** ASSIGNMENT still uses the full `leaveClash` (on leave the listing day
  OR the prep day before → don't hand them the matter). But CREDIT follows actual
  PRESENCE ON THE LISTING DAY only — `presentSharers` / `shareForDate` zero a
  colleague's share ONLY if he's on leave THAT day (`onLeaveOn(date)`), NOT the day
  before. Rationale (owner): a colleague marked on a matter who was on leave merely
  the previous day still appeared and did the work, so the credit is his; only leave
  ON the listing day zeroes his share and redistributes it to whoever was present.
  This flows through `shareFor` → `activeLoad` / `lifetimeCount` / `loadInWindow`.
  Live-verified: on-leave-yesterday → credited; on-leave-today → 0, share to the
  present co-assignee.
- **Workload snapshot is a CALENDAR period (Jul 2026 fix), not a rolling ±window.**
  The Chamber-tab week/month/year tally (`loadInWindow`/`casesInWindow` via
  `periodRange`) attributes a matter to the calendar week (Mon–Sun) / month / year
  of its **listing date**, NOT by `assignedAt`. Old bug: a ±30-day "month" window
  from mid-July spanned into August AND counted by assign date, so a matter listed
  4 Aug showed in July's tally. Now: listed 4 Aug → counts only in August's
  week/month (and the current year); a matter with a July listing + an August next
  hearing counts once in each month (per appearance); an undated active matter
  counts in the current period. jsc-verified (10 cases) + live (week ≤ month ≤ year
  monotonic, drill-down works, no errors).
  So standing load decides WHO is next; the cap only limits the RATE of catch-up
  (a returning-light colleague gets ~2 then the rotation moves on, and keeps
  catching up in the next window). Proven with a jsc sim vs the real functions:
  burst 0-vs-5 → gets 2 not 6; 0-vs-20 → still capped at 2; equal loads → clean
  round-robin. If none eligible → **forced** assign to lightest-loaded non-leave
  member, `{forced:true}` (flagged toast). Auto-pick previews now show the pick's
  load ("Name · N active — lightest") for transparency.
- `autoAssign` sets assignedTo=[pick], status=assigned, resets `ackBy=[]`,
  stamps `assignedAt`, appends assignHistory, then `advancePointer()`.
- **Objections:** normal brief → auto-advance to next eligible (objector
  excluded per-brief via declinedBy), pointer advances. **Directed brief**
  (`directed:true`, "on Senior's direction") → NO auto-advance; sets
  `heldForClerk:true`; clerk's board shows a held notice with "Keep as
  assigned" (clears hold) or manual reassign. Directed assignment does NOT
  consume a roster turn but DOES count toward load.
- **Acknowledgment:** every (re)assignment starts unacked. Junior sees banner
  + "Acknowledge assignment" button; clerk sees "unseen · Nd" ageing on the
  board and per-assignee clock icons in the detail; WhatsApp "Nudge" buttons
  (see below).
- Manual assignment via briefForm keeps acks only for still-assigned juniors;
  new assignees need fresh ack; clears heldForClerk if team changed.
- Roster tab: fixed seniority order (joinedOn; no reordering), "Next up"
  marker, per-junior joined date + active load / total load / live / lifetime
  / objection counts, pointer reset, and the matter-weights editor (clerk/pa).

## Word-causelist import (index.html, Jul 2026 — REGRESSIBLE)

Reads the clerk's own daily-causelist **Word (.docx)** and lifts each matter into
the day sheet — court, item, briefing counsel (+ party), chamber colleague(s) and
conference times — so the clerk can keep preparing his familiar Word file and Adith
imports it in one step. **Fully isolated + removable** (owner: "if I don't like it,
regress"): everything lives in ONE block (search `WORD-CAUSELIST IMPORT`) gated by
`const WORD_IMPORT=true;` plus one button in `renderToday`. Set the flag false (button
vanishes) or delete the block to return to the exact prior state — **no schema/data
changes**; imported rows are ordinary day-sheet entries + briefs.

- **Reading .docx with NO external library:** a .docx is a ZIP of WordprocessingML.
  `_zipEntry` walks the ZIP central directory to `word/document.xml`, `_inflateRaw`
  inflates it with the platform `DecompressionStream("deflate-raw")` (Safari 16.4+/
  Chrome 80+ — fine on the clerk/Adith's phones), `_docxTable` parses it with
  `DOMParser` (namespaced `w:tbl/w:tr/w:tc/w:p/w:t`; a cell's paragraphs → `\n`
  lines). Hardened: stray `&` that isn't a valid entity is escaped before parse
  (real Word escapes them, but a macro/paste doc may not).
- **Clerk's layout (ground truth — matched to his real sheet):** table columns
  `Court/Item | Time | Case Name | Judges | Advocates Name | Total matter`.
  `Ct-1#28` → court 1, item 28. The Advocates cell: **line 1 = briefing counsel + a
  party marker** (`(R)`,`(P)`,`-P`,`R-2`,`P`… → `_wiCounsel` sets appearingFor
  Petitioner/Respondent); **the lines below = chamber colleagues**, `/`- or
  `,`-separated (`Adith D/Anshula`), each matched to a uid by `_wiMatchColleague`
  (first-name + initial fuzzy). Conferences (`2.30 - Nishant Patil`) are lifted and
  **linked to the matter whose counsel matches the name** (sets that entry's
  confTime); unmatched conferences become standalone daysheet.conferences rows (no
  colleague → no ½-credit, exactly like a plain counsel meeting).
- **Per-conference DATE (owner Jul 2026):** the clerk's flat conference list has no
  dates but the meetings span the eve-before and the day-of. The preview gives every
  conference a date picker (default = the listing day) plus two bulk buttons ("all →
  eve before", "all → day-of"). A linked conference's chosen date rides onto its
  matter's `confDate` (so the matter's conference lands on the right day); a
  standalone one is stored with that `date`. The day sheet already groups conferences
  by date, so a mixed set shows under separate day headings (e.g. Fri 24th + Sat
  25th). Verified live: moving two of the 13 confs to the day-before regrouped them
  under a 24 Jul heading while the rest stayed on 25 Jul.
- **Editable preview before any write** (`renderWiPreview`): every parsed matter with
  an include checkbox, counsel+party, conf time, matched-colleague chips (removable)
  and a "+ colleague" fixer for anything unrecognised; then "Add N to <date>".
  `applyWordImport` reuses `findBriefForListing` (links an existing register file by
  title, else creates one) — imported matters get credit/registered identically to
  hand-typed ones. Blocked on senior-unavailable days like every other add.
- Verified: jsc unit tests (counsel/party, colleague split, Ct-x#y, conf lines,
  fuzzy name-match — 24 cases) + **full end-to-end in the demo**: a generated .docx
  fed through the real ZIP→inflate→WordML→parse→preview→apply path produced 4 matters
  (correct court/item, multi-line titles, counsel+party, colleagues matched to demo
  users) and 5 conferences (4 auto-linked, 1 standalone), no console errors.
  `sw.js` cache `chamber-shell-v22→v23`.

## Cause list (owner's "nothing would beat this" feature)

Flow: SC list gets indexed once per day → clerk types **Court + Item** →
entry autofills (title/caseNo/diaryNo), matches the register (diaryNo exact
match first, then caseNo substring), pre-tags assignedTo[0] as junior; no
register match → added with remarks "Not in register". Duplicate court+item
refused. Entries auto-sort by court then item.

Index sources, in priority order:
1. `data/scindex-<date>.json` in the repo (committed by the GitHub Action) —
   fetched same-origin on Pages, flagged `fromRepo:true`, wins over Firestore
2. `scindex/{date}` Firestore doc, written by the in-app "Load SC list" paste
   modal (paste PDF text → `parseSCList()` → saves index AND offers
   checkbox-add of chamber matches)

`parseSCList(text)`: tracks `COURT NO.` headers; `^(\d{1,3})[.)]\s` starts an
item; block scanned for diary (`\d{3,6}[/-]\d{4}`), caseNo (prefix regex:
SLP|W.?P|C.?A|CRL.?A|T.?P|R.?P|M.?A|CONMT|CONT|ARB|CUR|DIARY), and
"X Versus Y" title. Best-effort; hardening against real PDFs is pending.

**Share** button (day-sheet toolbar, visible to all members once the sheet has
content) opens an editable plain-text preview in the clerk's own paper format —
`SENIOR NAME / SUPREME COURT (DAY) DD.MM.YYYY`, then per matter
`n) Ct-<court>#<item> — <time>` / title / `Bench: …` / `counsel — junior / junior`
/ `(remarks)`, then `Conferences and meetings:` with `time — name` lines — with
Copy / WhatsApp (`wa.me/?text=` on mobile, `web.whatsapp.com/send?text=` on
desktop, UA-sniffed) / mailto buttons acting on the edited text. This IS the
clerk's delivery mechanism; composer lives in `shareText()`/`shareDaySheet()`.
**Print** button (beside Share) — `printCauseList()` opens a print window in the
clerk's PAPER format: centred `SENIOR NAME` (big caps) + italic "Senior
Advocate", underlined `SUPREME COURT (DAY) DD.MM.YYYY`, then the six-column
table (Court/Item · Time · Case Name · Judges · Advocates Name · Total matter;
Advocates cell = briefing counsel over "/"-joined colleagues), then Conferences.
EB Garamond (Google Fonts) 14px, serif fallback. Print is triggered from the
PARENT after `w.document.fonts.ready` — no inline script in the written HTML.
Admin is a `canManage()` superset, so Adith can add matters + print like Staff.

## SC cause-list auto-fetch (Jul 2026 — owner's "enrich entered listings" model)

Ported+reworked from the ASD app's proven pipeline. Files: `fetch_causelist.py`,
`.github/workflows/causelist.yml` (hourly 08:00–23:00 IST Mon–Sat), output
`court-updates.json` at repo root, `CAUSELIST-SETUP.md`. The fetcher is
change-detecting: `probe_size()` does a 1KB ranged GET per list URL and reuses
the previous parse (stored `sources:{date:{suffix:size}}` in the output) unless
a size changed; identical results leave the file unwritten so the workflow
commits nothing (`generated_at` = time of last CHANGE). App side: a long-open
tab re-fetches court-updates.json on visibilitychange / Day-Calendar tab switch
when older than 10 min (`courtUpdatesAt`/`courtUpdatesStale`). **Model:** the scheduled Action can't read
Firestore, so it does NOT search for the chamber's matters (owner rejected the
ASD watchlist/name-discovery approach). It downloads the 6 SC list PDFs for a
rolling 8-weekday window and extracts, per (date → list-type → court), the
**bench (coram)** + total/fresh. Staff enter court/item/**listType**/date on the
day sheet; the app (`loadCourtUpdates` → `coramFor(date,type,court)` →
`cleanCoram`) auto-fills the authoritative bench and prints it. No watchlist.json.
Jul 2026 UPGRADE: the fetcher also stores `items:{itemNo: case-line}` per court
(case number + parties, ~96KB/day for ~1150 items). The Add-matter form now
takes just **court + item** as the primary inputs; `lookupCauselistItem(date,
court,item)` searches ALL list types (item-number ranges differ so court+item is
unique) and fills case title (`titleFromCauseLine`), list type, and bench.
Everything else on the form is optional.
- Item capture (Jul 2026): parse_courts grabs the petitioner line + the line
  after "Versus" (`caseLine` = "PET .. VERSUS RESP .."). **total/main/supp count
  only SERIAL matters** via `n_matters()` = keys without a "." — connected matters
  are stored as sub-items ("4.1", "102.2") for lookup but the court lists them
  UNDER their main item, so counting them (old `len(items)`) over-reported every
  court (Court 5's 30 read 32). PARSER_VERSION bumped so the Action re-parses all
  cached dates. App `titleFromCauseLine` strips the case-no prefix, splits on
  VERSUS, trims each side at "& Ors./and Anr." (drops the trailing AoR),
  title-cases → "Petitioner vs Respondent". Bug fixed: the entry form tracks
  what IT auto-filled (`auto{title,bench,type}`) so typing item "3"→"30" lands
  on the FINAL item's case, and a value the clerk edits is never overwritten.
- Briefing counsel is an `<input list="lawfirms">` datalist of top Indian firms
  (`LAW_FIRMS`) — pick or type any AoR. Each entry has an optional `confTime`
  (add now or edit later). `conferenceList(date)` builds the Conferences section
  (day sheet + print + share) from entries' confTime: "time — counsel", and
  when a counsel has >1 conference that day, "(FirstWordOfCauseTitle)". Manual
  daysheet.conferences[] merge in.
- `resolveEntry(e,date)` returns title/bench/listType/total from the entry
  falling back to the fetched causelist — used by rail, table, share AND print
  so a court+item-only entry completes once its list is fetched.
- Print heading = "SUPREME COURT (DAY) DATE"; `<title>` (= saved PDF file name)
  = "SD Causelist DATE". Columns: Court/Item (one line) | Time | Case Name |
  Judges | Advocates | Total & Seq. (court total + item seq). EB Garamond 14.
- **Ordering (Jul 2026, owner's rule):** `byCourt(arr, date)` groups by LIST TYPE
  first — every court finishes its Miscellaneous list before its Regular list, so
  ALL Misc matters (court-wise) print before ANY Regular matter, then the rest, in
  `CAUSELIST_TYPES` order (`_typeRank`). Within a type: court, then item. An entry
  carrying a `listType` is used directly; a court+item-only entry resolves its type
  via `resolveEntry(e,date)`. Single sort → day sheet display, print AND share all
  follow it. **Print fits one page for a busy day** (owner's 12-matter 15th + two
  conference days): top margin cut (`@page margin:6mm 11mm 8mm`, `body margin:0`
  — header sits at the top edge). Font sizing balances "one page" against the
  clerk's **"too small / too faint"** feedback: **weight 500 throughout** (EB
  Garamond 400 printed faint; headers 700, and the font link now loads the 500
  weight), case name 13px, judges/advocates 11px (cols widened to 114/120 so names
  don't wrap), court/item 13.5px, line-heights ~1.2. Conferences use a
  DETERMINISTIC two-column flex (`.cfsplit`/`.cfcol`), NOT CSS multicol (which
  balanced unpredictably and fragmented onto page 2): one conference day → its
  rows split left/right; two+ days → each day fills a column (e.g. 8 on the
  14th-evening left, 2 on the 15th-morning right). Measured faithfully against an
  A4 box (REAL print CSS, heavy 12-matter rows): ~1028px vs ~1070px printable →
  ~42px headroom. **Don't enlarge the font without re-measuring the worst-case fit.**
- Jul 2026 (2nd pass): Add-matter form order = **Causelist type FIRST**, then
  court+item (lookup is scoped to the chosen type — `lookupCauselistItem(...,
  preferType)`). Fetcher captures **sub-items** (ITEM_LINE_RE = `N` or `N.M`,
  e.g. 37.1 "Connected .."). Party cleaning: `cleanCauseSide` strips the
  case-TYPE prefix ("SLP(C) No.") even when the number sits on the next PDF
  line, strips a leading "Connected", trims trailing AoR at "& Ors./and Anr.".
  `partiesFromCauseLine`→{pet,resp}; `renderTitle(title,appearingFor,mode)`
  bolds the side we appear for (`<b>` in html, `*..*` in WhatsApp text) — entry
  has `appearingFor`. Time + conference time are `<input list="courttimes">`
  (COURT_TIMES datalist).
- List-type → PDF suffix (verified against real 13-07-2026 PDFs, via an
  authorised one-time probe): Miscellaneous `M_J`, Regular `F_J`, Chamber `M_C`,
  Single Judge `M_S`, Registrar `M_R`, Curative & Review `M_CC`; `_1` main,
  `_2` supplementary. Server returns 200-HTML for missing files, so `fetch_pdf`
  checks Content-Type is application/pdf.
- `parse_courts()` (in the fetcher) collects the coram only on a court's FIRST
  header (page headers repeat → would duplicate). `cleanCoram()` (in the app)
  turns "HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE …" into the clerk's short form; the honorific regex
  needs `\b` (else "MRS" matches "MR" and leaves a stray "S.").
- Validated OFFLINE against real downloaded PDFs (never hammer the live site in
  dev). court-updates.json fetched with `?_=Date.now()` + no-store (Pages CDN).
  A 13-07-2026 seed is committed; the Action overwrites it on first run. Owner
  must enable workflow write permission + run once (see CAUSELIST-SETUP.md).

## SC annual calendar import (Jul 2026)

The SC publishes an annual calendar (image PDF, no text layer — can't auto-parse)
each Nov/Dec. `SC_CALENDAR` encodes it per year: `holidays:[[from,to|null,name]]`
+ `vacation:[[from,to,label]]` (summer partial-court period). Calendar tab →
**Import SC calendar** (admin): one-click `applySCYear(year)` expands the ranges
into `config/holidays` (merge) and writes `config/vacation`; a paste box takes
future years line-by-line ("YYYY-MM-DD Name" / "YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD Name").
`config/vacation` = {ranges:[[from,to,label]]}, watched into `vacation`;
`isPartial(iso)` shades vacation weekdays "Partial court" (holiday > weekend >
partial priority). To add a year: extend `SC_CALENDAR` from the published PDF.

## Lookup note

`lookupCauselistItem(date,court,item,preferType)`: a chosen `preferType` is
AUTHORITATIVE — NO cross-type fallback (picking Miscellaneous can't return a
Registrar matter). Only an empty type searches all lists. The form message
distinguishes "no list fetched for this date" from "not in the <type> list".

## Calendar & brand visuals (Jul 2026 — calmed down)

- Calendar cells are NEUTRAL. The only strong colour is a small workload DOT in
  a pill beside the count: `.ld.lg`<5 green, `.ld.ly`5–10 amber, `.ld.lr`>10 red
  (load = max(register next-dates, day-sheet entries)). Non-working days get one
  faint mute + a thin left accent: `.day-hol` purple, `.day-vac` amber,
  `.day-off` weekend (no accent) + a muted `.cal-tag`. One-line dot legend.
  (Owner found the earlier full-cell tints overwhelming — keep it restrained.)
- **Refresh button** (topbar, `#btnRefresh`/`hardRefresh`): clears caches +
  updates SW + reloads with cache-buster — for installed PWAs holding an old
  shell. sw.js CACHE bumped when the shell changes (currently v3).
- Brand: circular seal emblem `.brand-mark` (navy field, double gold rule, gold
  Fraunces SD) on the login + pending cards; `.sb-logo` is the ring-emblem
  variant in the sidebar. Login = radial navy gradient, gold "CHAMBERS OF",
  Fraunces name + short gold rule. Stay within navy #101418 / gold #cbb682.

## Colleague "My work" home (Jul 2026)

Juniors are phone-first users, so the Work-board tab renders `renderMyWork()`
for `me.role==="junior"` (Staff/admin keep the distribution board). It's a
personal home: 4 metrics (to-acknowledge / my active / coming-up ≤4d / roster
position), a one-tap availability set (Available/In court/Half day/On leave →
`availability/{uid}_{today}`), an "acknowledge / object" card per unacked
assignment, their matters sorted by next date (imminent flame), and roster
standing ("#N · next up in M turns · X active · Y lifetime"). App is responsive
throughout: fixed sidebar ≥860px, dark bottom-nav <860px.

## Out-of-app notification

`waLink(uid, brief)` → WhatsApp deep link with prefilled nudge message;
mobile→wa.me, desktop→web.whatsapp.com (clerk uses WhatsApp Web on his PC,
QR-paired once). Copy-message fallback button beside every nudge. Phone
stored per user (10 digits → auto-prefix 91). True push (FCM + Functions)
is explicitly v2.

## Design system (do not drift)

Modern institutional, spacious. Tokens in `:root`: bg #f5f5f3, ink #141719,
sidebar #101418, single accent #3a5a8c, gold #cbb682 only in sidebar-active/
demo bar. Fonts: Fraunces (serif — masthead, page titles, case titles, metric
numerals ONLY), Inter (UI), IBM Plex Mono (diary/item/court numbers).
Desaturated status chips. Desktop: fixed left sidebar; mobile ≤860px: sidebar
hidden, dark bottom tab bar (5 tabs). **Board defaults are OPEN** (owner's
Jul 2026 reversal of the earlier collapse-by-default): balance panel starts
open, junior cards start expanded (`uiExp.cardsClosed` tracks user collapses).
Day sheet renders as the clerk's paper TABLE on desktop (>860px: Ct/Item ·
Time · Case & Bench · Counsel — Juniors · Remarks) and as the card rail on
mobile — both markups render, CSS switches. Still collapsed: day-sheet clerk
tools behind "⋯" (rail only), detail Files/Discussion, roster explainer.
Unassigned queue is ALWAYS open (it's the action list).
Icons: Tabler webfont via jsdelivr CDN.

## Security rules (`firestore.rules` now IN the repo — reconstructed)

`firestore.rules` was MERGED (Jul 2026) from the owner's actual live console
rules + the new features: admin role (by email AND role, get()-safe against a
missing users doc), `approvals` (read: any signed-in; write: admin; self-delete
of own invite), `config/holidays` (admin), `config/senioravail` (canManage),
constrained self-create of `users/{uid}` (role must be `pending`, or the admin
email, or match a pre-approval keyed by lowercased email). config is enumerated
so the catch-all (admin-only) never widens holidays. Still must be PUBLISHED in
the console by the owner. If `CHAMBER.adminEmail` changes, change it here too.

## Security rules (legacy notes; keep in lockstep with app writes)

Junior may update ONLY these brief fields (rules enforce):
`status, updatedAt, ackBy, declinedBy, heldForClerk, assignedTo, everAssigned,
assignHistory, assignedAt` — i.e. status moves, acknowledge, and the
objection's onward reassignment. Any new junior-writable field MUST be added
to that hasOnly list or production silently permission-fails where demo works.
`config/*`: clerk/pa full; any approved member may change `pointer` only
(objection advances rotation). Files/comments: any approved member reads all,
creates own; clerk/pa delete. daysheets rule still mentions role `senior` —
vestigial, harmless, cleanup candidate. If rules change, the owner must
re-paste in Firebase console (walk him through it; he edits nothing locally).

## Testing conventions (all proven in this project)

- Syntax gate after every edit: extract the module script → `node --check`.
  **The owner's Mac has no Node.** Use JavaScriptCore instead:
  `/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Versions/A/Helpers/jsc`
  with a tiny script calling `checkModuleSyntax(readFile("_mod.mjs"))`.
  Behaviour checks: `python3 -m http.server` + the harness's preview tools
  (demo copy = `sed 's/const DEMO = false;/const DEMO = true;/' index.html >
  app.html` — the repo does not actually contain demo.html/app.html).
- Behaviour: Playwright headless Chromium against `file://.../app.html`
  (demo mode), viewport 1320×1000 desktop / 390×844 mobile, collect
  `pageerror`. Role-switch via `#demoRole` select (all seeded users listed)
  or `window.__demoSetUser(uid)`.
- Known harness quirks: clipboard writeText is permission-denied headless
  (not a bug); after modal submits, clear `#modalRoot` between steps;
  select_option fails if the option isn't in #demoRole.
- Engine logic: replicate pickNext in a standalone node script for unit
  tests (lightest-load, leave-skip, objector-exclusion, forced fallback,
  20-round fairness spread ≤3).

## Known wrinkles / cleanup candidates

- Dead code in `seedDemo`: an empty `Object.entries({b23:...}).forEach` block
  (harmless leftover; remove when touching the seed).
- PWA is now fully wired (Jul 2026): manifest linked, apple-touch-icon, iOS
  meta tags, SW registered, "SD" monogram icons. An already-installed shortcut
  keeps its OLD icon until removed and re-added to the device.
- Demo seed titles/numbers are synthetic; `scindex` demo entries mirror seed
  formulas (diary = 27000+i*37, case = 7000+i*13) — keep in sync if reseeding.
- File delivery to the owner via chat downloads is unreliable; he now hosts
  `demo.html` in the repo. Prefer giving him GitHub-pencil-edit instructions
  or small paste-able diffs over new file downloads.

## Pending (rough priority)

1. **Autofetch first SCHEDULED run** — the parser is validated offline against
   real PDFs, but the Action's live scheduled run is its first end-to-end;
   watch the first `causelist-bot` commit. Owner must enable workflow
   write-permission + run once. Possible optimisation: it re-downloads the huge
   M_J list 6×/day per window-day; could skip dates already parsed.
2. FCM push notifications via Firebase Functions (shared backend decision
   with the owner's ASD app — build once, serve both).
4. Native file uploads (needs Blaze; schema already URL-based so it's
   additive).
5. Rules cleanup (drop vestigial `senior`), icons, seed cleanup.

## Working with the owner

Adith is an Advocate on Record — sophisticated, direct, allergic to
over-agreement. Flag weak reasoning proactively; he has corrected fabricated
claims before and expects "tested" to mean actually tested (show the check).
He makes design decisions fast when given crisp options with trade-offs.
Legal-domain terminology must be exact (diary no. vs case no., AoR,
mentioning, pass-over). The clerk-simplicity constraint is load-bearing:
every new clerk-facing feature must survive the question "can a man who only
knows WhatsApp and email use this without training?"
